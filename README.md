__Option 1__: Download and run locally

- Install a copy of Jupyter Notebook. The official guide from Jupyter is [here](https://jupyter.org/install)
    - It's recommended to install a Python distribution with Jupyter Notebook included (e.g. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)) so you won't get any issues.
- Download the appropriate notebooks
- Run Jupyter Notebook and view the downloaded notebooks

__Option 2__: View only using Binder

- Copy a chosen notebook URL
- Go to Binder https://mybinder.org/
- Paste the URL and Launch the notebook
